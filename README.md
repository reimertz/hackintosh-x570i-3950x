# hackintosh-x570i-5950x
This repository contains Open-Core Utilities + EFI-folder for my Hackintosh build.
Dual-boot with Windows 10 and Big Sur 11.4. 

A lot of love to [ChanceArthur](https://github.com/ChanceArthur) and his [article](https://chancearthur.com/notes/macos-on-the-asus-rog-strix-x570-i) that helped me getting a stable build.

## Components

Worth noting that I initially had two Corsair NVMe disks but one died. This is a know problem so if I where you, i'd stay away from them and get two Samsung Samsung 980 PRO instead if you are looking for dual booting.
